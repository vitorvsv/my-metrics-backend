## Description

This is a project that uses NestJS to create a backend for a metrics application. The project is built using TypeScript and follows the principles of: SOLID, Clean architecture, Test-Driven Development, and Domain Driven Design.
All development is driven by necessity, so if you don't see something here that you think should be done, is just because the necessity for it hasn't arisen yet.
It is a project developed to be used as a study case for the author, so if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
